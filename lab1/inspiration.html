	<h1>Inspiration</h1>
	<p>As a breakcore music producer I've been inspired by many different producers of the same genre as well <br>
	as electric avant-garde metal bands with roots of their music going right into spirituality and absolute madness.</p>

		Gautier Serre aka <b>Igorrr</b>, is a French musician. Under the Igorrr alias, he combines a variety of disparate genres, 
		including black metal, baroque music, breakcore, and trip hop, into a singular sound. Serre is also part of the groups <b>Whourkr</b> and <b>Corpo-Mente</b>. 
		The Igorrr project became a full band with the addition of vocalists Aphrodite Patoulidou and JB Le Bail, drummer Sylvain Bouvier, guitarist Martyn Clément and bassist Erlend Caspersen.
		Igorrr claims to have synesthesia, as though perceiving music as colors. You can clearly hear the emphasize on vibrancy and dynamism in his works. Clearly something to look into.
		I'd recommend checking out these albums specifically: <i>Nostril (2010, Ad Noiseam)</i>, <span style="color: gold; font-style: italic">Hallelujah (2012, Ad Noiseam)</span>, 
		<i>Savage Sinusoid (2017, Metal Blade Records)</i>, <i>Spirituality and Distortion (2020, Metal Blade Records)</i>.

		<b>Desper / Desper of Ślepcy / dsp</b> - The father of polish breakcore scene, founder of Rygor Soundsystem based in Lublin. While still active, his dynamic pieces are as mesmerizing as ever.
		He specializes in use of drum machines, completely neglecting the use of breakbeats while generating his own samples to cut up and glitch them indefinitely. Hearing him perform live has
		always been an amazing experience. He's appeared on a few compilations released by netlabels such as <i>SKRD!!!</i>, <i>Suck Puck Records</i> and many more! He's recently released an album
		of his collected works <span style="color: gold; font-style: italic">Prace Zebrane (2022)</span>.

		<img src="img/sc3.jpeg" alt="Secret Chiefs 3" style="height: 240px; float: left; margin-right: 16px">
		<b>Secret Chiefs 3</b> is an American avant-garde group led by guitarist/composer <b>Trey Spruance</b> (of <i>Mr. Bungle</i>). 
		Their studio recordings and tours have featured different lineups, as the group performs a wide range of musical styles, mostly instrumental, 
		including surf rock, Persian, neo-Pythagorean, Indian, death metal, film music, and electronic music.
		In 2007, it was announced that Secret Chiefs 3 has always been a general name for seven different bands, 
		each representing a different aspect of Spruance's musical and philosophical interests. 
		The seven bands are <i>Electromagnetic Azoth</i>, <i>UR</i>, <i>Ishraqiyun</i> (my personal favourite), 
		<i>Traditionalists</i>, <i>Holy Vehm</i>, <i>FORMS</i>, and <i>NT Fan</i>. You never really know what to expect with these guys!
		While I'd recommend checking out their entire discography, I'd still consider these very good highlights: <br>
		<span style="color: gold; font-style: italic">Book M (2001, Web of Mimicry)</span>, <i>Hurqalya (Second Grand Constitution and Bylaws) (1998, Amarillo)</i>, <i>Malkhut (2018, Tzadik)</i>.
